            following up the request and are only communicated to third parties involved in processing the request (for
            this purpose CMAS could use third-party companies, for example, for commercial reasons or for analysis and /
            or marketing activities). Furthermore, the user / data subject is informed that, as it is planned - both for
            technical reasons and for the management of the Website - the generation and storage of backup copies of the
            data, certain types of information may continue to persist in the systems, even after cancellation (for a
            variable period but in any case strictly correlated with the backup procedures and the disaster recovery

            A cookie is a small text file that is stored by the device (computer, tablet, Smartphone) when a website is
            visited by a user. A cookie can store certain information that the website can read when, once it is
            accessed again, it is consulted again. Some of these cookies are necessary for the proper functioning of the
            website, while others are useful to the visitor because they can safely store, for example, the user name or
            the language settings. The advantage of having cookies installed in your PC is that you no longer need to
